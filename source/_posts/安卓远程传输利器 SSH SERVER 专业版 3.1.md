A complete and free SSHd, SFTP, SCP and Telnet server! From now on you can run a complete SSH daemon (server) with support for multiple users, public key authentication, and you can even set a directory per user for SFTP and SCP.
NO ROOT is required, but if you do have a rooted device you can run SSH as super user if you want. The shell will only work on ARM devices, however, the SFTP and SCP servers will work on all devices.
Note 1.
To run on ports below 1024 search for Android app Port Forwarder Ultimate.
Note 2\. If you find a bug or have a problem please contact us by email since we cannot help you if you post it in the reviews.

不做太多介绍。PC和安卓设备之间自建ssh传输还是比较方便。不需要root权限也能使用。
无广告 专业版 可在安卓设备上创建多个 ssh 服务器。
