There lies a miracle  
in the magic of love  
It makes a dormant heart  
become alive again  

It's our destiny  
to know each other  
in the big world  
and I unconsciously fall in love  

I can't help missing  
and I'm trying hard to pretend  
but it comes to me so naturally  
that I just cannot deny  
That Every day I love U
