Sing a song,  
you're the rhythm that lasts all the time!  
Close the eyes,  
you're the imagination that floats in my mind!  
Take a breath,  
you're the oxygen that melts into my life.  

In the morning of warm sunlight,  
you're thefresh breeze which caresses by my side.  
In the vivid daytime,  
you're the painting brush which colors every second of mine.  
In the evening of delicate moonlight,  
you're the shining star which burns eternally in my sky!
